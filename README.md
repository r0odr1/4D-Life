## Overview :writing_hand:
4D is a web application developed using React, Next.js, and CSS, allowing you as a customer to place home delivery orders for your favorite clothes and/or opt for in-factory pickup. As the owner, you can efficiently manage products. Through Strapi, you can easily add, edit, delete, and view products. You can also manage customers. The application connects to a backend CMS developed developed in Strapi to handle data. This repository contains the frontend structure. Here is the link to the backend repository: [Backend Repository](https://github.com/r0odr1/4D-Life_Strapi).
